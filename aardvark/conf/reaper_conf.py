The strategy that the reaper will use

Possible choices:

* strict: The purpose of the preemptibles existence is to eliminate the

          from the relevant hosts and tries to find the best matching
          for the requested resources. The best matching offer is the
          combination of preemptible servers that leave the least
          possible resources unused.

* strict_time: The purpose of the preemptibles existence is to eliminate the
               idling resources. This strategy gets all the possible offers
               from the relevant hosts and tries to find the best matching

               combination of preemptible servers that leave the least
               possible resources unused.

* chance: A valid host is selected randomly and in a number of
          preconfigured retries, the strategy tries to find the instances
          that have to be culled in order to have the requested
          resources available.
