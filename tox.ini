# E125 is deliberately excluded. See
# https://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/issues/126. It's just wrong.
#
# Most of the whitespace related rules (E12* and E131) are excluded
# because while they are often useful guidelines, strict adherence to
# them ends up causing some really odd code formatting and forced
# extra line breaks. Updating code to enforce these will be a hard sell.
#
# H405 is another one that is good as a guideline, but sometimes
# multiline doc strings just don't have a natural summary
# line. Rejecting code for this reason is wrong.

# E251 Skipped due to https://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/issues/301
